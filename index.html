  <h1>Mars Project Revision and Reflection</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <p>When I first completed the Mars Rover project, I was proud of the structure and content, but after showing it to a peer and a family member, they gave me valuable feedback. They said the images felt small, the layout was a bit cramped on mobile devices, and the mission timeline was easy to overlook. They also noted that the content was informative but didn‚Äôt feel visually engaging.</p>

    <p>Using that feedback, I made a complete revision. I created a new vertical timeline with glowing animated markers that fade in as you scroll. I adjusted the layout to include larger, clearer images of both Opportunity and Curiosity rovers. I used Flexbox to help organize the image galleries and made sure all pages were fully responsive. Everything was built using progressive enhancement: I started with a solid, semantic HTML base, layered on CSS for styling, and added JavaScript animations that don't break functionality if disabled.</p>

    <p>This project helped me apply everything I‚Äôve learned this semester ‚Äî HTML structure, positioning (like float and absolute), accessibility, responsive design, and even visual style. I now feel confident using semantic tags, organizing a multi-page project, and improving user experience without sacrificing performance or clarity. If I could go back, I‚Äôd start planning file names and folders more carefully to save time later. Still, I‚Äôm proud of how far the project has come, and how much I‚Äôve grown from the first draft to the final version.</p>

    <p>Throughout this course, I‚Äôve also learned how to troubleshoot layout issues, work with version control in GitHub, and organize my work in a way that‚Äôs clear and scalable. Collaborating with peers and getting feedback made a huge difference in how I approached revisions, especially when thinking about how other users experience the page. It reminded me that design isn't just about making things look pretty‚Äîit's about making them understandable, accessible, and enjoyable for everyone.</p>

    <p>In the end, this Mars Rover project represents both my creativity and technical growth. From basic HTML tags to polished, animated pages, I‚Äôve taken the skills we practiced in class and turned them into a final product I‚Äôm truly proud of. It reflects not only what I‚Äôve learned, but how much I‚Äôve grown in thinking like a designer and developer.</p>

    <h2>üìù Progressive Enhancement Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Progressive enhancement is a design philosophy that focuses on building web experiences that work for everyone, 
      regardless of their browser or device. The idea is to start with a basic, functional version of a website 
      that works on all browsers, and then add enhancements for users with more advanced capabilities. 
      This ensures accessibility and usability for the widest possible audience. 
      In this class, we learned that it‚Äôs better to build solid HTML first, then layer on CSS and JavaScript gradually 
      to enhance the user experience.
