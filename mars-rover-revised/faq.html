    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Curiosity & Opportunity</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>1. What is the Curiosity rover?</h3>
      <p>Curiosity is a car-sized rover launched by NASA in 2011 to explore Gale Crater on Mars. It landed in August 2012 and continues to study Mars’ climate and geology.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>2. What did Curiosity discover on Mars?</h3>
      <p>Curiosity found organic molecules, evidence of ancient lakes, methane gas variations, and clay-rich soil — all of which suggest Mars may have once supported microbial life.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>3. What powers the Curiosity rover?</h3>
      <p>Curiosity uses a nuclear-powered MMRTG (Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator), which gives it a long-lasting energy source for extended missions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>4. What is the Opportunity rover?</h3>
      <p>Opportunity was one of NASA’s twin Mars Exploration Rovers, launched in 2003 and landed in 2004. It vastly outlived its planned mission, operating for nearly 15 years.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>5. What were Opportunity’s biggest discoveries?</h3>
      <p>Opportunity discovered hematite spheres ("blueberries"), signs of past water activity, and evidence that Mars had wet conditions in its distant past.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>6. How did Opportunity get its power?</h3>
      <p>Opportunity was powered by solar panels. It eventually stopped communicating after a massive dust storm in 2018 blocked its sunlight.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>7. Are either of the rovers still active?</h3>
      <p>Curiosity is still active and exploring Mars today. Opportunity's mission ended in 2018 after it lost power, but it sent back valuable data over its long lifespan.</p>
